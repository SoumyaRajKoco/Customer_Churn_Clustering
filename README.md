## Dataset description

Customer churn pertains to the occurrence in which customers terminate their association or subscription with a company or service provider. It signifies the pace at which customers cease using a company's products or services within a specific timeframe. Churn stands as a pivotal metric for businesses, exerting a direct impact on revenue, growth, and customer retention.

In the context of the Churn dataset, the churn label denotes whether a customer has undergone churn or not. A churned customer is one who has opted to discontinue their subscription or utilization of the company's services. Conversely, a non-churned customer is someone who persists in their engagement and upholds their relationship with the company.

Comprehending customer churn is imperative for businesses aiming to discern patterns, factors, and indicators contributing to customer attrition.

Through an examination of churn behavior and its associated characteristics, companies can formulate strategies to retain existing customers, enhance customer satisfaction, and diminish customer turnover. Employing predictive modeling techniques also facilitates the anticipation and proactive handling of potential churn, empowering companies to take pre-emptive actions to retain customers at risk.

Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship or subscription with a company or service provider. It represents the rate at which customers stop using a company's

products or services within a specific period. Churn is an important metric for businesses as it directly impacts revenue, growth, and customer retention.

In the context of the Churn dataset, the churn label indicates whether a customer has churned or not. A churned customer is one who has decided to discontinue their subscription or usage of the company's

services. On the other hand, a non-churned customer is one who continues to remain engaged and retains their relationship with the company.

Understanding customer churn is crucial for businesses to identify patterns, factors, and indicators that contribute to customer attrition.

By analyzing churn behavior and its associated features, companies can develop strategies to retain existing customers, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce customer turnover. Predictive modeling 

techniques can also be applied to forecast and proactively address potential churn, enabling companies to take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers.
